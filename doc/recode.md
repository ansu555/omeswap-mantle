### [2026-05-03 10:05:00 Z] agent=claude user=anik branch=market_place
- upgrade_paths: doc/recode.md, graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md, graphify-out/graph.html, graphify-out/graph.json
- upgrade_summary: Resolved 4-file rebase conflict between agents and market_place branches. Merged all recode log entries chronologically; accepted theirs for auto-generated graphify files (GRAPH_REPORT.md, graph.html, graph.json). Rebase completed cleanly across all 4 commits.

---

### [2026-05-03 15:22:40 Z] agent=codex user=ansu555 branch=agents
- upgrade_paths: tests/test_integration.py
- upgrade_summary: Added a full ATS integration test suite that validates cross-module communication across orchestrator graph routing, Redis handoffs, Agent6 execution flow, stop-loss monitoring, Postgres receipt updates, RAG/chat grounding, API-to-pipeline wiring, and startup lifecycle behavior. The suite uses real internal module wiring while mocking only external systems.

### [2026-05-03 13:55:00 Z] agent=claude user=anik branch=market_place
- upgrade_paths: components/marketplace/buy-panel.tsx, components/creator/publish-wizard.tsx, app/(app)/marketplace/page.tsx, app/(app)/marketplace/strategies/[id]/page.tsx, app/(app)/creator/page.tsx, components/agent-builder/canvas/PublishModal.tsx
- upgrade_summary: Implemented full marketplace frontend. Created BuyPanel (wagmi useSendTransaction/useWriteContract EVM payment → treasury → POST purchase API → Activate Now unlock). Created 4-step PublishWizard (details/risk/privacy+pricing/preview with AES-256-GCM encryption info, free/paid toggle, payout wallet). Rewrote marketplace home with featured horizontal scroll row, platform picks, trending, new arrivals, free/paid sections, and filter sidebar (pricing, risk, win rate floor, asset, regime). Rewrote strategy detail with prominent stat tiles, alpha score, human_summary display, BuyPanel in sidebar, perf tabs, version history, no code exposure. Created creator dashboard with metrics bar (activations, purchases, earnings), strategy/indicator tables with actions, draft continuation links. Wired PublishModal to render PublishWizard for strategy mode, keeping flat indicator form.

Wired into the LangGraph orchestrator replacing the Phase 7 stub node; stop-loss task launched at FastAPI startup. 52/52 tests passing.

---

### [2026-05-03 08:35:00 Z] agent=claude user=anik branch=market_place
- upgrade_paths: components/marketplace/strategy-card-v2.tsx
- upgrade_summary: Created StrategyCardV2 component with win-rate/trades/drawdown/alpha stats grid, 5-dot alpha score visualisation, free/paid badge, platform-pick badge, verified/watch/paper status badge, asset pair chips, risk-level colouring, and Buy/Use Free CTA buttons. Type-compatible with the EnrichedCard shape returned by GET /api/marketplace/featured.

### [2026-05-03 08:20:00 Z] agent=claude user=anik branch=agents
- upgrade_paths: supabase/migrations/20260503000000_marketplace_payments.sql, app/api/creator/strategies/[id]/publish/route.ts
- upgrade_summary: Added marketplace payments migration (is_free/price columns on strategies, zerog_root_hash on strategy_versions, strategy_purchases table with RLS). Updated publish route to AES-256-GCM encrypt strategy payload via sealStrategyPayload(), store rootHash in strategy_versions.zerog_root_hash, write only the encrypted marker to the payload column, and auto-generate human_summary via generateHumanSummary() when not supplied by the caller.

### [2026-05-03 08:10:00 Z] agent=claude user=anik branch=agents
- upgrade_paths: lib/zerog/private-strategy.ts, lib/zerog/index.ts, .env.example
- upgrade_summary: Created strategy privacy layer (`lib/zerog/private-strategy.ts`) — AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt of compiled strategy payloads, upload/download via 0G Storage, and `generateHumanSummary()` via sealed qwen3.6-plus inference. Added STRATEGY_ENCRYPTION_KEY and NEXT_PUBLIC_TREASURY_WALLET to .env.example. Barrel re-export added to lib/zerog/index.ts.

### [2026-05-03 07:12:00 Z] agent=claude user=anik branch=agents
- upgrade_paths: doc/idea.md
- upgrade_summary: Added comprehensive 0G protocol integration mapping to the ATS idea doc. Section 2.4 documents exactly where each 0G component is used: 0G Chain (Layer 3 execution), 0G Storage (persistent agent memory — KV state + Log history, Decision Receipt storage with root hash), 0G Compute (Conversation Layer with qwen3-8b, sealed ZK inference via qwen3.6-plus/GLM-5-FP8 for Signal Agent causal gate and Risk Agent pre-trade gate), 0G DA (swarm coordination messages, large inference result blobs, market data attestation). Updated Chain Adapter table, ML Stack table, and Decision Receipt structure to reference 0G fields.

### [2026-05-03 09:17:00 Z] agent=claude user=ansu555 branch=agents
- upgrade_paths: ats/agents/execution/__init__.py, ats/agents/execution/dex_client.py, ats/agents/execution/order_router.py, ats/agents/execution/fill_monitor.py, ats/agents/execution/portfolio_updater.py, ats/agents/execution/stop_loss_monitor.py, ats/agents/agent6_execution.py, ats/orchestrator/graph.py, ats/api/main.py, tests/test_phase7.py

Added `anthropic_api_key` to Settings with fallback to `agent_api_key`. Added `anthropic>=0.97.0` to requirements.txt. 43/43 tests passing.

### [2026-05-03 15:22:40 +0530] agent=codex user=ansu555 branch=agents
- upgrade_paths: tests/test_integration.py
- upgrade_summary: Added a full ATS integration test suite that validates cross-module communication across orchestrator graph routing, Redis handoffs, Agent6 execution flow, stop-loss monitoring, Postgres receipt updates, RAG/chat grounding, API-to-pipeline wiring, and startup lifecycle behavior. The suite uses real internal module wiring while mocking only external systems.

### [2026-05-03 18:04:00 +0530] agent=claude user=anik branch=agents
- upgrade_paths: supabase/migrations/20260503_agent_wallets.sql, supabase/migrations/20260503_user_settings.sql, supabase/migrations/20260503_decision_receipts.sql, lib/agent-wallet/crypto.ts, lib/agent-wallet/manager.ts, app/api/agent-wallet/route.ts, app/api/agent-wallet/withdraw/route.ts, app/api/user-settings/route.ts, .env.local
- upgrade_summary: Implemented ATS agent wallet infrastructure: three Supabase migrations (agent_wallets encrypted burner EOA table, user_settings with encrypted API key + model/mode, decision_receipts ATS extension with agent_votes/regime/causal_chain/risk_sizing/consensus columns). Added lib/agent-wallet/crypto.ts (AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt using AGENT_WALLET_MASTER_KEY), lib/agent-wallet/manager.ts (getOrCreateAgentWallet — generates viem burner EOA, encrypts private key, upserts to Supabase), GET+POST /api/agent-wallet (init + balance check), POST /api/agent-wallet/withdraw (native + ERC-20 sweep back to user wallet), GET+PUT /api/user-settings (encrypted API key + model + mode). Added AGENT_WALLET_MASTER_KEY and OPENROUTER_API_KEY placeholders to .env.local.

### [2026-05-03 18:42:00 +0530] agent=claude user=anik branch=agents
- upgrade_paths: components/portfolio/AgentWalletCard.tsx, components/portfolio/AgentSettingsCard.tsx, components/portfolio/index.ts, app/(app)/portfolio/page.tsx
- upgrade_summary: Rewrote AgentWalletCard to self-fetch from /api/agent-wallet — shows real burner EOA address, A0GI balance, copy+explorer link, status pill (Not Initialized / Needs Funding / Initialized / Ready for Autonomous Mode), Fund (SendToAgentDialog via wagmi useSendTransaction) and Sweep Back buttons. Added new AgentSettingsCard with masked OpenRouter API-key input, model dropdown (Claude/Gemini/GPT-4o/Qwen3), and trading-mode radio (Autonomous/Assisted/Solo) persisted via PUT /api/user-settings. Updated portfolio page to 3-equal-column grid (NetWorth | AgentWallet | AgentSettings) and auto-triggers POST /api/agent-wallet on first visit to initialize the burner EOA.

### [2026-05-03 18:54:00 +0530] agent=claude user=anik branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: lib/ats/types.ts, lib/ats/llm.ts, lib/ats/data/prices.ts, lib/ats/data/news.ts, lib/ats/indicators.ts, lib/ats/causal-chains.json
- upgrade_summary: Bootstrapped the ATS core library. types.ts defines all shared types (AgentVote, Regime, Mode, Decision, DecisionReceipt, RunEvent, Candle, DataBundle, NewsBundle, TechnicalSignals, SentimentScore, CausalChainEntry). llm.ts is a thin OpenRouter client that resolves the user's encrypted API key + model from user_settings then falls back to env OPENROUTER_API_KEY; exports callLLM, callLLMJson, streamLLM. prices.ts fetches CoinGecko OHLC (90d daily + 7d sub-daily) with volume back-fill and a quality score. news.ts fetches CoinDesk/CoinTelegraph/The Block RSS, parses raw XML, deduplicates, and tags items with recognised ticker symbols. indicators.ts implements SMA, EMA, RSI-14 (Wilder), MACD-12/26/9, Bollinger Bands-20, ATR-14, and a computeTechnicalSignals() convenience bundle. causal-chains.json seeds 30 documented crypto causal chains (trigger conditions, affected assets, reliability scores) for use by the Signal Agent.

### [2026-05-03 19:30:00 +0530] agent=claude user=anik branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: lib/ats/agents/data-agent.ts, lib/ats/agents/regime-agent.ts, lib/ats/agents/signal-agent.ts, lib/ats/agents/graph-agent.ts, lib/ats/agents/risk-agent.ts, lib/ats/agents/execution-agent.ts, lib/ats/orchestrator.ts
- upgrade_summary: Implemented all 6 ATS agents and the orchestrator. Data Agent fetches price+news bundles in parallel and emits quality metrics. Regime Agent uses a rules-based HMM-lite (30d volatility, 7d slope, RSI, volume ratio) followed by LLM validation to classify market regime (bull_trending/volatile, bear_volatile, sideways, accumulation, distribution). Signal Agent runs 4 parallel sub-modules — pure-JS Technical (35%), LLM Sentiment (30%), LLM Causal-chain (20%), LLM Institutional (15%) — weighted into a combined AgentVote. Graph Agent computes BTC-correlation from a static mid-2025 matrix + dynamic candle adjustment, then uses LLM enrichment for cross-asset directional implication. Risk Agent applies fractional Kelly criterion (25% multiplier) with hard veto rules (data quality, drawdown, Kelly sign, min trade size, consensus absence). Execution Agent dispatches to UniswapV2 (0G) or V3 (Ethereum SwapRouter02) based on chain registry router type; handles ERC-20 approval and placeholder-address detection. Orchestrator runs the full 5-phase pipeline (data → parallel agents → risk → consensus → execution), persists DecisionReceipt to Supabase decision_receipts, and emits typed RunEvents at every step for SSE streaming.

### [2026-05-03 19:55:00 +0530] agent=claude user=anik branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: app/api/research/run/route.ts, app/api/research/receipts/route.ts
- upgrade_summary: Added /api/research/run SSE endpoint and /api/research/receipts list endpoint. The run route authenticates via requireWallet, parses {query, ticker?, mode?, chainId?, executionApproved?}, loads user mode from user_settings (fallback to solo), idempotently initialises the agent wallet for Kelly balance estimation, streams all RunEvents from runOrchestrator as text/event-stream, then best-effort uploads the final DecisionReceipt blob to 0G Storage via saveAgentMemory and back-fills storage_root_hash in decision_receipts. The receipts route returns paginated ATS receipts for the authenticated user with optional ticker filter.

### [2026-05-03 20:30:00 +0530] agent=claude user=anik branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: store/research.ts, components/research/nodes/AgentNode.tsx, components/research/AgentGraphCanvas.tsx, components/research/ResearchChat.tsx, components/research/DecisionReceiptDrawer.tsx, app/(app)/research/page.tsx, components/layout/header.tsx
- upgrade_summary: Built the /research page UI: Zustand store (store/research.ts) managing xyflow nodes/edges + chat messages + currentReceipt with a single applyEvent() dispatcher; AgentNode custom xyflow node with idle/thinking/done/vetoed states, confidence bar, Signal Agent sub-task pills; AgentGraphCanvas (@xyflow/react) with 7 nodes in phase-ordered layout, animated edges on dataflow, legend, run-ID badge; ResearchChat consuming SSE from /api/research/run, quick-ticker selector, abort control; DecisionReceiptDrawer (Sheet) showing full structured receipt (trigger, regime, agent votes, consensus, risk sizing, causal chains, tx hash). Added Research + Terminal links to header nav.

### [2026-05-03 21:10:00 +0530] agent=claude user=anik branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: store/research.ts, components/research/ResearchChat.tsx
- upgrade_summary: Wired Autonomous/Assisted/Solo mode branching in chat UI. store/research.ts gains PendingApproval type, pendingApproval state, and clearPendingApproval action; applyEvent now sets pendingApproval on execution.pending(awaiting_approval=true) and clears it on run.start/run.done/run.error/execution.done. ResearchChat tracks lastQueryRef, passes executionApproved flag to /api/research/run on re-send, and shows an ApprovalBanner (Approve & Execute / Dismiss) when mode=assisted and pendingApproval is set. Header mode badge shows coloured Auto/Assisted/Solo pill; empty state shows mode-specific description.

### [2026-05-03 21:25:00 +0530] agent=claude user=anik branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: app/terminal/_components/TradePanel.tsx, app/terminal/page.tsx, components/research/ResearchChat.tsx
- upgrade_summary: Added agent-activity strip and deep-link approval flow to terminal. TradePanel gains AgentActivityStrip (collapsible list of last 5 ATS receipts from /api/research/receipts showing decision/ticker/size/tx status) and AgentApprovalBanner (shown when terminal is opened via /terminal?from=research&runId=...&decision=...&sizeUsd=...&ticker=...&query=... — streams /api/research/run with executionApproved=true and shows tx hash on completion). ResearchChat ApprovalBanner gains an "Execute in Terminal" button that deep-links to /terminal with all approval context encoded in URL params. terminal/page.tsx wraps TradePanel in Suspense for useSearchParams support.

### [2026-05-03 20:20:14 +0530] agent=codex user=anik branch=main
- upgrade_paths: app/terminal/layout.tsx, graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md, graphify-out/graph.html, graphify-out/graph.json
- upgrade_summary: Wrapped the standalone terminal route with theme and Wagmi wallet providers, and marked it force-dynamic so wallet-dependent terminal hooks do not prerender outside provider context during deployment builds. Refreshed Graphify metadata for the code change.

### [2026-05-03 20:00:05 +0530] agent=claude user=ansu555 branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: lib/axl/types.ts, lib/axl/config.ts, lib/axl/client.ts, lib/axl/index.ts, lib/ats/remote-agents.ts, lib/ats/orchestrator.ts, app/api/research/run/route.ts, scripts/axl-agent-service.ts, scripts/axl-demo.ts, package.json, .env.example, README.md, doc/axl.md, doc/guideline.md
- upgrade_summary: Added Gensyn AXL transport so ATS Regime/Signal/Graph/Risk agents can run on separate AXL peer nodes via MCP tools/call. Orchestrator selects local|axl|auto per run; remote adapters re-emit peer RunEvents tagged with payload.axl. New scripts: axl-agent-service hosts the agents as an MCP service registered with the AXL MCP router; axl-demo verifies topology, router, and one AXL-backed ATS run. Docs and env.example updated for hackathon submission.

### [2026-05-03 19:43:00 +0530] agent=claude user=ansu555 branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: .env.local
- upgrade_summary: Verified all three agent capabilities (research, trade, swap) against live OpenRouter API key. Added missing OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY alias to .env.local so the canvas agent route (app/api/agent-builder/agent/route.ts) can resolve the key alongside OPENROUTER_API_KEY. All four tests passed: research inference (Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite), swap canvas build (Claude Sonnet 4.5), LimitOrder trade logic, and SwapNode slippage math.

### [2026-05-03 19:13:00 +0530] agent=claude user=ansu555 branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: supabase/migrations/20260503_decision_receipts.sql, lib/ats/orchestrator.ts, app/api/research/receipts/route.ts, app/api/dev-migrate/route.ts, scripts/migrate-ats.ts, scripts/test-llm.mjs, scripts/create-ats-receipts.mjs
- upgrade_summary: Full end-to-end test with real OpenRouter API key (Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite). Discovered decision_receipts table had strategy_version_id NOT NULL constraint blocking ATS receipt inserts. Fixed by replacing ALTER TABLE approach with a dedicated public.ats_receipts table (cleaner separation from marketplace receipts). Updated orchestrator and receipts API to use ats_receipts. Fixed stored API key missing sk-or-v1- prefix causing silent LLM fallbacks. Confirmed: data agent fetches real CoinGecko prices, regime/signal/causal/graph agents make real LLM calls, risk agent applies Kelly sizing, receipts persist to Supabase. Pipeline fully functional — BTC analysis returned BUY (95% confidence) with institutional causal chain active.

### [2026-05-03 21:36:00 +0530] agent=claude user=ansu555 branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: components/layout/header.tsx
- upgrade_summary: Added "Builder" nav item pointing to /agent-builder with Cpu icon; it was missing from navItems despite the route existing.

### [2026-05-03 21:49:00 +0530] agent=claude user=ansu555 branch=swaping
- upgrade_paths: components/layout/header.tsx, components/ui/nav-bar.tsx
- upgrade_summary: Fixed nav overflow — replaced absolute/centered nav with flex-1 layout so Builder (9th item) is never clipped; reduced item padding px-6→px-3.5 and gap gap-3→gap-0.5 for a compact, fully-visible nav.

### [2026-05-04 16:45:26 +0530] agent=codex user=ansu555 branch=main
- upgrade_paths: .env.local, .axl/node-config-local-a.json, .axl/node-config-local-b.json, .axl/private-local-a.pem, .axl/private-local-b.pem
- upgrade_summary: Completed local two-node AXL demo setup end-to-end: built node binary, generated local peer identities, started Node A/Node B + MCP router + ats-agents service, fixed AXL env mapping, and validated live cross-node ATS events via `bun run axl:demo BTC solo` with successful remote regime/signal/graph/risk execution.

### [2026-05-04 16:47:30 +0530] agent=codex user=ansu555 branch=main
- upgrade_paths: .gitignore
- upgrade_summary: Added local-only AXL and Go tooling artifact paths to `.gitignore` to prevent unnecessary generated setup files from appearing in git status.

### [2026-05-04 17:44:49 +0530] agent=codex user=ansu555 branch=main
- upgrade_paths: app/(app)/trade/page.tsx, components/trade/PoolComparisonPanel.tsx, components/trade/SwapCardDex.tsx, hooks/use-dex-aggregator.tsx, lib/chain-registry/chains/zerog.ts, lib/chain-registry/index.ts, lib/agent-builder/zerog/provider.ts, contracts/config.ts, lib/dex/markets.ts, graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md, graphify-out/graph.html, graphify-out/graph.json
- upgrade_summary: Migrated the trade page to a 0G-only flow by removing Ethereum/Uniswap switching, updating swap defaults/copy from Avalanche assumptions, and wiring the Chart toggle to show Jaine pool metrics alongside OmeSwap pool status. Updated 0G network config to current chain IDs (mainnet 16661, Galileo testnet 16602) with environment-selectable endpoints, then refreshed Graphify metadata.

### [2026-05-04 17:51:57 +0530] agent=codex user=ansu555 branch=main
- upgrade_paths: components/trade/SwapCardDex.tsx, doc/recode.md, graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md, graphify-out/graph.html, graphify-out/graph.json
- upgrade_summary: Added a direct wrong-network recovery action on the trade swap card so users can switch to the configured 0G chain from inside the UI instead of being blocked on Ethereum. Kept validation green via full production build and refreshed Graphify metadata.

### [2026-05-04 17:58:58 +0530] agent=codex user=ansu555 branch=main
- upgrade_paths: hooks/use-dex-aggregator.tsx, components/trade/SwapCardDex.tsx, doc/recode.md, graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md, graphify-out/graph.html, graphify-out/graph.json
- upgrade_summary: Improved no-liquidity handling by distinguishing missing router configuration from real pool absence. The swap UI now offers direct fallback to 0G Hub Swap (Jaine) when onchain router addresses are placeholders, plus a quick W0G→USDC pair suggestion when configured routers exist but the selected pair has no route.

### [2026-05-04 18:18:54 +0530] agent=codex user=ansu555 branch=main
- upgrade_paths: components/layout/header.tsx, components/terminal/tiles/OrderPanelTile.tsx, app/(app)/pool/[id]/page.tsx, doc/recode.md, graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md, graphify-out/graph.html, graphify-out/graph.json
- upgrade_summary: Completed trade-page disable rollout by removing the Trade tab from the primary nav and replacing internal /trade entry points with external 0G Hub actions. Pool and terminal quick actions now direct users to Hub while preserving in-page swap card behavior where applicable.

### [2026-05-04 19:00:00 +0530] agent=claude user=ansu555 branch=main
- upgrade_paths: app/terminal/_components/Header.tsx, app/terminal/_components/TradePanel.tsx, app/terminal/_components/Chart.tsx
- upgrade_summary: Fixed non-functional Connect Wallet buttons on the terminal page. Header now uses the WalletConnect component; TradePanel and Chart buttons are wired to useConnectModal from rainbowkit.

### [2026-05-04 19:04:00 +0530] agent=claude user=ansu555 branch=main
- upgrade_paths: app/terminal/_components/TradePanel.tsx, app/terminal/_components/Chart.tsx
- upgrade_summary: Fixed terminal page showing Connect Wallet even after wallet is connected. TradePanel now shows Buy/Sell action button when connected; Chart Positions tab shows "No open positions" instead of the connect prompt.

### [2026-05-04 19:30:00 +0530] agent=claude user=ansu555 branch=main
- upgrade_paths: lib/chain-registry/chains/zerog.ts, app/terminal/_components/TradePanel.tsx, app/terminal/_components/Chart.tsx
- upgrade_summary: Made terminal page data real. (1) Updated zerog.ts with verified on-chain token addresses for W0G (0x1cd0690...) and USDC.e (0x1f3aa82...) from on-chain pool query. (2) TradePanel now reads live ERC20 balances for W0G and USDC.e using wagmi useReadContract on 0G mainnet (chain 16661) — "Available to Trade", "Total Balance", "Available Balance" all show real wallet amounts. (3) Buy/Sell button on 0G spot market opens Jaine Hub (confirmed via on-chain tx tracing that Jaine uses a proprietary non-standard router). (4) Swaps tab now shows a live sortable trade table fetched from GeckoTerminal with side, price, amount, USD value, and timestamped tx links to chainscan.0g.ai; refreshes every 30s.

### [2026-05-04 19:45:00 +0530] agent=claude user=ansu555 branch=main
- upgrade_paths: app/terminal/_components/TradePanel.tsx, app/terminal/_components/Chart.tsx, doc/recode.md
- upgrade_summary: Replaced the external Jaine Hub terminal CTA with an in-site 0G swap path. Verified the Jaine W0G/USDC.e pool is V3/CLMM-style (slot0/fee present, getReserves absent) and inferred the standard V3 SwapRouter address from live successful swap calldata. TradePanel now switches to 0G, approves the selected input token to the inferred Jaine V3 router, and submits exactInputSingle from inside Omeswap; balances/allowance refresh after confirmation. Removed external deposit/trade links and cleaned an unused Chart helper so `bunx tsc --noEmit` passes.

- upgrade_paths: lib/dex/jaine.ts, lib/ats/agents/execution-agent.ts, app/api/research/run/route.ts, app/terminal/_components/TradePanel.tsx, doc/recode.md
- upgrade_summary: Unified manual and agent Jaine execution behind a shared adapter. Added lib/dex/jaine.ts with verified W0G/USDC.e token addresses, inferred V3 router address, exactInputSingle ABI, trade-plan sizing, allowance/approval, and wallet-client execution. ATS Execution Agent now routes 0G W0G/USDC.e autonomous/assisted-approved trades through the shared Jaine adapter using the encrypted agent wallet, while unsupported 0G tickers are skipped with an explicit message. Research ticker extraction now recognizes W0G/0G; terminal manual swaps import the shared adapter constants. Validation passes with `bunx tsc --noEmit`.

- upgrade_paths: app/api/agent-builder/agent/route.ts, components/agent-builder/canvas/AgentSidebar.tsx, doc/recode.md
- upgrade_summary: Wired the Agent Builder assistant to the Portfolio Agent Settings API key. The sidebar now forwards the connected wallet address, and the builder API route loads the user's encrypted OpenRouter key/model from user_settings before falling back to env keys.

- upgrade_summary: Removed stale AVAX/Avalanche user-facing copy from the Agent Builder sidebar, prompts, templates, exposure display, chart/backtest defaults, and node defaults so the builder presents as Omeswap/0G with W0G-oriented defaults.
